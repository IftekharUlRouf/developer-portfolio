            <h3>What is a Portfolio and everything</h3>
            <p>As per portfolio definition, it is a collection of a wide range of assets that are owned by investors.
                The said collection of financial assets may also be valuables ranging from gold, stocks, funds,
                derivatives, property, cash equivalents, bonds, etc. Individuals put their money in such assets to
                generate revenue while ensuring that the original equity of the asset or capital does not
                erode.Depending on one’s know-how of the investment market, individuals may either manage their
                portfolio or seek the assistance of professional financial advisors for the same. As per financial

            <p>The time-frame of putting money on a particular investment option is also quite crucial for building a
                profitable portfolio. As the general rule suggests, investors should modify their portfolio to achieve a
                conservative asset allocation mix as they approach nearer to their financial goals. It is followed to
                prevent accumulated earnings of their investment portfolio from eroding.Typically, investors who are
                nearing their retirement are recommended to invest a more significant portion of their portfolio in less
                risky assets like – cash and bonds and the remainder in higher-yielding options. On the other hand,
                those who have just begun their career are suggested to invest the larger portion of their portfolio
                into high risk-reward investment options for the long haul. A longer time frame will help them to ride
                out the short-term market fluctuations and losses.</p>
